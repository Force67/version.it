# list of tokens that are stripped from both commit messages and changelogs

# this tells the versioning engine what to do, when a given label is found
# - null means that the label is known, but ignored
# - minor means that the label will cause a minor version bump
# - patch means that the label will cause a patch version bump
# - major means that the label will cause a major version bump, i don't recommend this, as this
#   should be reserved for breaking changes, and thus be done manually
